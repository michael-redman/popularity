POPULARITY-SLIDESHOW

Still-image slideshow module for popularity, an adaptive music, video, and photo randomplayer for Debian Linux.


Installation

Popularity-slideshow runs on Debian Linux and NetBSD.

Popularity-slideshow depends on the main popularity application, which you can clone from github.com/michael-redman

To bulid and install popularity-slideshow:


root@yourhost:~# aptitude install xli libx11-dev

(NetBSD users should run ". ./NetBSD-env.sh" first to source some environment variables).

you@yourhost:/usr/local/src/popularity/slideshow$ make
root@yourhost:/usr/local/src/popularity/slideshow# make install


Use

Before using Popularity-slideshow you need to set up a database, and import the schema at /usr/local/share/popularity/slideshow/schema.sql and all of the common SQL functions at /usr/local/share/popularity/common/sql/

Popularity-slideshow uses the full-screen root window and is therefore designed for use with window managers that either take up no screen space by default (like 9wm) or can "hide" themselves (like Icewm - use "TaskBarAutoHide=1" in ~/.icewm/preferences).

See popularity_rebalance(1) for how to build a weighted distribution file for the slideshow program to use.

Start slideshow:

you@yourhost:~$ popularity-slideshow photos@your.db.host.ip .popularity/dbname=example/max_sn1.dist

"=" key requests, "-" key skips, "q" quits.

Request arbitrary files by path:

you@yourhost:~$ popularity-find-photos ~/some/dir | popularity-slideshow-request photos@your.db.host.ip


IN GOD WE TRVST.
