POPULARITY-SLIDESHOW

Still-image slideshow module for popularity, an adaptive music, video, and photo randomplayer for Debian Linux.


Installation

Popularity runs on Debian Linux.

Popularity-slideshow depends on popularity-common, which you can clone from github.com/michael-redman

To bulid and install popularity-slideshow:

root@yourhost:~# aptitude install xli libx11-dev
you@yourhost:/usr/local/src/popularity-slideshow$ make
root@yourhost:/usr/local/src/popularity-slideshow# make install


Use

See the documentation for popularity-common on setting up a database, importing songs, and building probability distribution files.

Popularity-slideshow uses the full-screen root window and is therefore designed for use with window managers that either take up no screen space by default (like 9wm) or can "hide" themselves (like Icewm - use "TaskBarAutoHide=1" in ~/.icewm/preferences).

Start slideshow:

you@yourhost:~$ popularity-slideshow photos@your.db.host.ip flat.dist sharpened.dist

"=" key requests, "-" key skips, "q" quits.

Request arbitrary files by path:

you@yourhost:~$ popularity-find-photos ~/some/dir | popularity-slideshow-request photos@your.db.host.ip


IN GOD WE TRVST.
