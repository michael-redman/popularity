POPULARITY

Adaptive music, video, and photo randomplayer for Debian, NetBSD, and Cygwin

Copyright 2017 Michael Redman


-Installating Dependencies-

First install the dependencies with your system's package manager.

Cygwin: bc cron postgresql-client libpq-devel make gcc-core man-pages-posix
Debian: bc postgresql-client libpq-dev make gcc
NetBSD: postgresql-client

On Cygwin, run the Cygwin setup .EXE program, and proceed through the dialogs until you get to the dialog where you get to select packages to install, and then select the dependencies listed. On Debian, run "apt-get install postgresql-client libpq-dev make gcc" as root. On NetBSD, determine the current package version for postgresql-client at ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/pkgsrc/packages/NetBSD and then use pkg_add to install it.


-Installing Popularity-

If you have not already fetched the source, also install git (the packages is "git-core" on Debian), and clone the repostiory:

git clone https://github.com/michael-redman/popularity-common

Then enter that directory:

cd popularity-common

At this point, if you are under Cygwin or NetBSD, source the shell file containing the environment variables you need to build on your platform, for example:

. ./Cygwin-env.sh

Then "make" and "make install" like normal.

After installing popularity-common, you will also need to install at least one of popularity-player or popularity-slideshow. They are also hosted at

-Further Documentation-

Documentation for Popularity is in POSIX man pages. Once Popularity is installed, type "man popularity-common" at the command prompt for the main index page. The manual pages both tell you how to get started using Popularity, and document Popularity's main commands.


IN GOD WE TRVST.
