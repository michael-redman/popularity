Adaptive media randomplayer for Debian, NetBSD, and Cygwin

-Installating Dependencies-

First install the dependencies with your system's package manager.

Cygwin: bc cron postgresql-client libpq-devel make gcc-core man-pages-posix sox
Debian: bc postgresql-client libpq-dev make gcc sox
NetBSD: postgresql-client sox

On Cygwin, run the Cygwin setup .EXE program, and proceed through the dialogs until you get to the dialog where you get to select packages to install, and then select the dependencies listed. On Debian, run "apt-get install postgresql-client libpq-dev make gcc sox" as root. On NetBSD, determine the current package version for postgresql-client at ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/pkgsrc/packages/NetBSD and then use pkg_add to install it.


-Installing Popularity-

If you have not already fetched the source, also install git (the packages is "git-core" on Debian), and clone the repostiory:

git clone https://github.com/michael-redman/popularity

Then enter that directory:

cd popularity

And run:

make

Then as root:

make install

--Optionsal Slideshow Module--

There is an optional photo slideshow module, not installed by default, see the documentation in slideshow/README.


-Further Documentation-

Documentation for Popularity is in POSIX man pages. Once Popularity is installed, type "man popularity" at the command prompt for the main index page. The manual pages both tell you how to get started using Popularity, and document Popularity's main commands.


IN GOD WE TRVST.
