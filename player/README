POPULARITY-PLAYER

Music and video module for Popularity adaptive entertainment system.


-Installing Dependencies-

If you have not already done so, first please install popularity-common. It is hosted at https://github.com/michael-redman

If you do not already have git installed, also install git and sox (and mplayer if you want to play video) using your operating system's package manager. On Cygwin, run the Cygwin utility and proceed through the dialogs until the package installation dialog appears. On Debian, run "apt-get install git-core sox mplayer" as root. On NetBSD, determine the current package versions at ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/pkgsrc/packages/NetBSD and install them using pkg_add.


-Installation-

Once you have git, popularity-common, and sox installed, fetch the popularity-player source:

git clone https://github.com/michael-redman/popularity-player

Then enter that directory:

cd popularity-player

If you are running NetBSD, source the shell file with some needed environment variables. If not, skil this step:

. ./NetBSD-env.sh

Then run "make" (from your regular user account), and "make install" as root.


-Further Documentation-

popularity-player is documented in online manual pages. Type "man popularity-player" for the main index page. These manual pages detail how to import music into the system and start the shuffler.
